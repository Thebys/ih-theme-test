/*
  This file is included from main.scss and just includes styles for each page that needs additional styling.
  Keep in mind that all the styles are present on all pages of the website so you need to use CSS classes to make
  the rules work only where you need them to.

  Hopefully the names of files are self explanatory, I will just note the ones that are deprecated.
